## About
This project shows users the workflow of the app, Unscammed, which is targeted for elderly people to educate them on how to avoid scam calls.

A color and index is displayed for any incoming calls, with unrecognized call likely market with yellow or red to warn users.
The assumption made is that the OS default incoming call screen can be overridden.

'Robo-voice' is a voice disguise mechanism, which can be toggled on and off.
Speech recognition is designed to recognize common scam schemes.
